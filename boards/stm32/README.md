# STM32 Example Board Setup

This folder is a placeholder for STM32-specific startup files, HAL configuration,
and camera drivers.

## Suggested next steps

- Add the vendor startup files and linker scripts.
- Provide a `board.c` with clock and peripheral initialization.
- Integrate your camera driver into `src/preprocess/`.
